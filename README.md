## About Me
I am a Junior in highschool interested in software development and computer science. Through this project, I have applied and improved my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS by creating interactive games and a portfolio website.

## About My Project
This project showcases what I have learned throughout the year in AP Computer Science. It features multiple JavaScript games I built, including a Cookie Clicker, Hangman, and Pong game. These projects helped me practice programming concepts such as functions, event handling, arrays, loops, and DOM manipulation. Additionally, I improved my problem-solving skills by debugging and refining these games.

## My Site Includes:
- A home page  
- About me section  
- My JavaScript projects  
- Links to my social profiles  

## Projects:
- **Cookie Clicker:**  
  A fun clicking game where you earn points by clicking a cookie and can buy upgrades to increase your score faster.

- **Hangman:**  
  A classic word guessing game where you try to guess the hidden word by selecting letters before running out of attempts.

- **Pong Game:**  
  A two-player Pong game using the HTML5 canvas where players control paddles and compete to score points by hitting the ball past the opponent.
